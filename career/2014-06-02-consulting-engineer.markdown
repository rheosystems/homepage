Job Description

The main challenge is to use your theoretical knowledge to implement
practical solutions to our clients problems.

You will typically work at clients and spend most of your time on the
factory floor or construction site where you will gather data and
engage with clients to understand the specific environment within
which our client operate.

Possible improvements will be discussed with the client to validate
your understanding and agree on an implementation strategy. Tools and
techniques used to understand the problem and develop a solution
includes:

- Time study on processes.
- Value stream mapping.
- Process mapping.
- Process descriptions.
- Layout drawings.
- Analysis of existing data.
- Basic statistical analysis.
- Organograms.
- Process standardisation.
- Developing quality specifications.

The job requires working on site at clients and in most cases, daily
transport to and from client with own vehicle. Working hours are
typically long, since you will be following the working hours of our
clients and stay late to discuss improvements.
