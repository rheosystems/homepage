title: Improve Quality to Reduce Accidents
---

Accidents arise when there is force involved. Something is
heavy. Something moves fast. I have to push hard, my hand slips, and I
hit it against the machine or part I was working on.

In assembly if the parts are of poor fit and I have to force it to
fit, whether by hand or by using a hammer, then there is a risk of
injury.
