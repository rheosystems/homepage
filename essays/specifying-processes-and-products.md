title: Specifying Processes and Products
---

Processes and products cannot be perfectly specified. We can only
specify certain parameters, properties, attributes, or qualities. It
is for example not possible to specify a table, but only attributes of
the table, that is, dimensions, height, material, surface finish,
color, etc. The theoretical limit would be to specify the position and direction
of every molecule.

Underspecifying could mean that we do not get what we want and
overspecifying could make it more difficult to produce (and more
expensive) than required. In practice specifications are refined over
time.

In general we will use parameters when we talk about processes and
attributes when we talk about products.

For reference the definition of 'parameter' and 'property' from
Wikipedia is given below. There was no separate definition of
'attribute'.

> A parameter (from the Ancient Greek παρά, para: "beside",
> "subsidiary"; and μέτρον, metron: "measure"), generally, is any
> characteristic that can help in defining or classifying a particular
> system (meaning an event, project, object, situation, etc.). That
> is, a parameter is an element of a system that is useful, or
> critical, when identifying the system, or when evaluating its
> performance, status, condition, etc.

> In philosophy, mathematics, and logic, a property is a

> property of redness. The property may be considered a form of object
> in its own right, able to possess other properties. A property
> however differs from individual objects in that it may be
> instantiated, and often in more than one thing. It differs from the
> logical/mathematical concept of class by not having any concept of
> extensionality, and from the philosophical concept of class in that
> a property is considered to be distinct from the objects which
> possess it. Understanding how different individual entities (or
> particulars) can in some sense have some of the same properties is
> the basis of the problem of universals. The terms attribute and
> quality have similar meanings.
